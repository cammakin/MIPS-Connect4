# Welcome to my CMPEN 351 Final Project! MIPS Connect 4 Game

Connect 4 written in Assembly for the MIPS ISA for RISC (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages, instruction set architecture, reduced instruction set computer)

I decided to recreate the Connect 4 Game
Motivation to create this game was that we were instructed to create a game that would take approx. 3 weeks worth of lab time.
Also, the best way to demonstrate literacy in a programming language is by creating a game!
To properly set this game up: Set the MARS Bitmap settings to 8x8 pixels with a 512x512 display and connect to heap base memory
User Input is taken from the physical keyboard (No keyboard polling bologna)
Enjoy!
